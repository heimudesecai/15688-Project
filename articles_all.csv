other reasons dropped to only 3% and mother-to-child HIV transmission accounted for one per cent of such cases.“Apart from infections through sexual relations, HIV can be transmitted from the mother to the unborn child, blood transfusionsor organ transplants and contaminated needles, ” said the Health Ministry.Deputy Health Minister Dr Lee Boon Chye said the government was committed to continuing its efforts to reduce the number of cases of HIV transmission in the country via various approaches.“Efforts via harm reduction programmes to reduce HIV transmission between drug addicts will continue and so will educating the community with regards to the risk of unsafe sexual activities such as unprotected sex with multiple sex partners, ” he said yesterday.Dr Lee added that the Health Ministry would continue providing free treatment to HIV-infected patients at its facilities in order to improve their survival and quality of life.“Treatment of patients will also significantly reduce the risk of transmission to others, ” he said.Meanwhile, Malaysian AIDS Council (MAC) president Bakhtiar Talhah said the rate of HIV infections dueto sexual activities was on the rise, affecting more of the younger generation between the ages of 18 and 35 in Malaysia.“In general, I think we have very poor awareness of reproductive health and sex education.“We don’t equip young Malaysians with the proper information and tools to protect themselves not just from HIV, but also from other sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.“Infection rates due to gay sex are also increasing here and globally, ” said Bakhtiar.He added that this was especially so in countries such as Malaysia, where key populations (or at-risk groups) such as MSM and transgenders were marginalised and criminalised.“When you marginalise a population, it drives them further underground and makes it even harder for them to access healthcare, information to protection and also treatment.“It aggravates the situation even more, ” he said.He said the MAC had been treating HIV as a public health issue and not a moral issue, adding that the key to reducing infections lay in education, awareness and upholding human rights for all.“Every Malaysian should have equal access to treatment, knowledge and education, free from stigma, ” he said.At the same time, Malaysia should also be proud of its success in eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission last year, being the first country in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Western Pacific region to do so, said Bakthiar.“We were also the first in the region to implement harm reduction programmes in the form of needle exchange and methadone replacement therapy for drug users, and this has seen results, ” he said.MAC executive director Parimelazhagan Ellan said the rate of HIV transmission cases due to MSM was seeing a rise as members of the key population had started coming forward in recent years due to better access to HIV testing compared to the 1990s.“Back then, they didn’t really get tested and they were stigmatised and scared.But now, there is a lot more access to testing available, ” he said.Pink Triangle Foundation chief operations officer Raymond Tai said the figures provided by the Health Ministry were “not alarming” as such a trend had been projected at least eight years ago.“The trend of HIV transmission cases shifting from being caused by injecting drugs to sexual transmission was something we foresaw about eight years ago, as it was happening not just in Malaysia but around the world.“The trend that MSM relations would overtake heterosexual relations as the main source of sexual transmission has also been forecasted by regional studies, ” he said.He added, however, that such cases were not addressed adequately as Malaysians looked at the issue through “moral lenses” instead of from a “biological and scientific perspective”.Tai said providing greater access to condoms and medication called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) would help Malaysian society prevent HIV transmission.Source: Department of Environment, MalaysiaContent PartnerOur Radio StationsVideo On DemandSITE MAPSUBSCRIPTIONS OTHER EDITIONS COMPANY INFO HELP ADVERTISING POLICIES OUR NETWORK SITES SOCIAL MEDIA Copyright © 1995-2019 Star Media Group Berhad (10894D)Best viewed on Chrome browsers."

All Rights ReservedAs a Singapore court prepares to hear a series of legal challenges to a law that bans gay sex, LGBT+ activists on Tuesday called for the “right” verdict to be delivered so similar reforms can be triggered across other parts of Asia.Like many other former British colonies, Singapore has retained an old law that criminalizes gay sex, which was scrapped by India in a landmark court ruling last year to give a boost to LGBT+ rights.Empowered by the Indian ruling, three Singaporean activists have launched separate bids in a renewed push to decriminalize gay sex in the city-state, where a high court is due to begin hearing their cases on Wednesday.“I think public opinion is pretty clear across religious and age segments that homosexuality should not be a criminal offense,” Johnson Ong Ming, who was among the trio, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Ong, a DJ is also known as DJ Big Kid, was the first to launch the case in September last year.The former head of an LGBT+ rights charity and a retired doctor also filed similar lawsuits later.“I have full confidence in our judicial system and I am hopeful that the court will come to the right decision … and overturn Section 377A,” Ong said by email.The court has set aside six days in November for the legal challenges to be heard but it is unclear when the proceedings will wrap up.Under Section 377A of Singapore’s Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of “gross indecency” with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare.The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.Singapore has emerged as a modern nation since independence six decades ago but socially it remains conservative, partly due to sensitivities stemming from multi-religious groups among its 5.6 million population.Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, although recent opinion polls indicated there has been growing support for gay rights.Opposition to gay marriage had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013, according to a poll of more than 4,000 people published in May by the Institute of Policy Studies, a Singapore think-tank.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, however, has previously said that Singapore society “is not that liberal on these matters”.The Singapore court cases are being closely watched by LGBT+ groups in some other parts of Asia that have maintained the colonial-era law, including in Myanmar and Malaysia.“If the decision in Singapore goes our way, then it will boost our morale here in Malaysia,” said Numan Afifi, president of the LGBT+ advocacy Pelangi Campaign in MalaysiaAung Myo Min, executive director from the Yangon-based Equality Myanmar LGBT+ campaign group said both Singapore and Myanmar “should follow the example of India” and repeal the archaic law.Gay sex is a crime in both countries, with those convicted facing sentences of up to 10 years in jail in Myanmar and 20 years in Malaysia.Download the Indian Express apps for iPhone, iPad or Android© 2019 The Indian Express Ltd.
